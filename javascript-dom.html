            <em>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS:</em> <br><br>

                HTML is like the roots, sap and trunk of a tree... whereas CSS is the branches, leaves and fruit.

            <em>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life:</em><br><br>

            Control flow is the order in which the computer recieves information, or the order in which you provide it with that information in order to achieve a certain outcome. 
            Loops are used to repeat that flow process, to carry out a function multiple times. This is comparable to when I make a coffee. First I boil the jug, then I grind the beans, then I put the ground coffee into the machine, then I press the double shot button, then the machine spits coffee into my cup below. Finally I top it off with the water I have boiled.
            This is a controlled flow process, where each step must occur after the other. A loop of this process is often necessary when my brain is overloaded with complex information and requires repeated caffeination.

            <em> Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:</em><br><br>

                The DOM is an interface that allows you to view the code of a website through a console such as Chrome Developer Tools. It is manipulable in realtime on your local server, 
                without effecting the actual version of the site accessed by other users.

            <em> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</em><br><br>

                Arrays and Objects are both used to store information in an index. Arrays are lists of values. The array "pets" could contain (lizards, cats, donkeys). Alternatively objects are used to store clusters of data points and can thus be used to store information in a more complex manner.
                An example of an object could be "donkey list" {name: Don, age: 30, colour: grey, tails: 1, name: Bob, age: 12, colour: brown, tails: 2}.

            <em>Explain what functions are and why they are useful:</em><br><br>

            A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value in your code. It recieves an input and returns an output dependant on the conditions that are contained within it.
