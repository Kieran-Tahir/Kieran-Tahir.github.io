        <h1> About</h1>
        <p class="text"> Hi everyone! I'm Kieran, I just joined the Pohutukawa cohort here in Auckland last week so have a lot of catching up to do, but I'm looking forward to the challenge!
            Recently I've been thinking a lot about my place here in Aotearoa New Zealand. <br><br>
            I'm originally from Scotland and prior to Covid I used to go back regularly to spend time with my family there. 
            As this is no longer possible, I have had to reconsider my sense of place and belonging here which has been an intriguing journey in terms of my personal identity. <br><br>
            I am attending Dev Academy because a friend did it and recommended it to me! I am very interested in incorporating web development skills into progressive social and political projects in the future and I look forward to meeting you all along the way!
