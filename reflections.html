            Identity and Values <br><br>
<b> 1.	Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</b> <br><br>
o	<em>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</em> <br> <br>

In a restaurant I worked in several years ago I observed my boss repeatedly treating another member of staff unfairly. This staff member was constantly being made to work longer and harder shifts than the rest of us for no greater pay. 
He was at a vulnerable point in his life and felt trapped in the job, which my boss took advantage of. 
Eventually another staff member and I discussed this, conferred with our colleague and decided to intervene on his behalf, who we saw to be in great distress. 
We spoke to our boss and called him out on his mistreatment of our colleague. We emphasised the importance of the values of equal pay for equal work and respect for individual dignity. 
Our colleague was grateful for the conversation we had with our boss and it sparked a significant shift in their relationship over the following months. <br><br>

o	<em>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </em><br><br>

My upbringing has been defined by a merging of various cultures and a general confusion around my place within those cultures. 
This has greatly shaped my personal values of acceptance of difference and open-mindedness toward contrasting world views. 
It has also massively impacted my personal national and ethnic identity, which sits somewhere between British, Pakistani and Tauiwi New Zealander. <br><br><br>

<b>2.	Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</b> <br><br>
o	<em>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</em> <br><br>

In terms of learning and career development I think my key strengths are my adaptability and creativity, which helps me able adjust well to new spaces and ideas. 
With regard to career development I like to think carefully and cautiously about my next steps and always prioritise my long-term goals over hasty decisions, which I view as a strength. 
My key learning limitations are my tendency to procrastinate and get easily distracted by other things going on in my life. 
My main career development limitations are my inability to stick to a clearly defined path and my constant desire to do things a bit differently, which can often be to my detriment.<br><br>

o	<em>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</em><br><br>

I think my strengths will help me adapt quickly to the coding landscape and become fully immersed in the new things I am learning. However I will have to work hard to maintain my focus on the primary tasks at hand and not veer off down a slightly-unrelated code rabbit hole. <br><br>

o	<em>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</em>
<br> <br>
I was met with resistance and faced tension when working on a project with a friend last year. 
The key issue was that my friend did not seem to acknowledge my role in founding the project and was constantly attempting to push me out of the project. 
In order to address this issue and move forward with the project together I wrote an email to him reflecting on the origins of the project and our shared work as well as outlining our respective roles going forward. 
This strategy was effective in the short term and meant that we were able to work constructively on the project together over the course of several months. 
In the long term it has not proved to be so fruitful however and I have subsequently distanced myself from the project due to the tensions that I faced working on. 
Reflecting back on this, I would now choose to go down a more assertive route - being much clearer on my position within the project and reinforcing that position consistently.
